    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Me</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Mikaela June and I am currently 24 years old. I grew up in Southington, CT for most of my life until moving to Tampa, FL for college. I decided to go to school down south to get out of the snow and into the sun and heat.</p>
    <p>Growing up I played many different sports including softball, basketball, soccer, volleyball, and football. My main sport that I focused on growing up was softball where I played on travel teams competing all over the east coast. Once I got to Highschool I quit my schools softball team and tried my hand at track where I ran the 400m hurdles and threw javelin which I fell in love with.</p>
    <p>I have always been into art, baking, and being able to be creative. <span class="sentence">I love to draw, crochet, garden, and build.</span>  I am the type of person who if I think I can do, make, or build something myself I will do it.</p>
    <p>I am the oldest daughter, granddaughter, and niece in my family. I have one sister who is four years younger than me named Mia. A fun little fact about my immediate family is that all of our names start with the letter M. This was not always my parents plan but thought my sister may feel left out if she was the only one whose name didn't start with an M.</p>
