    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Me</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Mikaela June and I am currently 24 years old. I grew up in Southington, CT for most of my life until I moved to Tampa, FL for <span id="college">_________</span>. I decided to go to school down south to get out of the snow and into the sun and heat.</p>
        <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('college').innerHTML = firstVariableValue">college</button> <br />
    <p>
        Growing up I played many different <span id="sports">_________</span> including softball, basketball, soccer, volleyball, and football. My main sport that I focused on growing up was softball where I played on travel teams competing all over the east coast. Once I got to Highschool I quit my schools softball team and tried my hand at track where I ran the 400m hurdles and threw javelin which I fell in love with.
        <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('sports').innerHTML = secondVariableValue">sports</button> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I have always been into art, baking, and being able to be creative. <span class="sentence">I love to <span id="draw">_________</span>, crochet, garden, and build.</span>  I am the type of person who if I think I can do, make, or build something myself I will do it.
        <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('draw').innerHTML = thirdVariableValue">draw</button> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I am the oldest daughter, granddaughter, and niece in my family. I have one sister who is four years younger than me named Mia. A fun little fact about my immediate family is that all of our names start with the letter <span id="M">_________</span>. This was not always my parents plan but thought my sister may feel left out if she was the only one whose name didn't start with an M.
        <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('M').innerHTML = fourthVariableValue">M</button> <br />
